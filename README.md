# No-Freeze-Updated
All credit goes to https://github.com/Poragon/No-Freeze I cant do a pull request due to it being archived so heres the updated version. I fixed the comestible_type error, by adding "copy-from": to a few of the .json files that needed it. I also had to change the type for both paper and cardboard to "type": "GENERIC" instead of "type": "COMESTIBLE". If any errors pop up that make it unusable please let me know so I can fix it right away, but I use this mod myself so I am hoping to be able to stay on top of that.
